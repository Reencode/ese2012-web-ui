# Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle)

The verb and request url is determined, the the following is searched:

<verb> "<request url>" do 

then the method resolved and executed, returning one of the three:
 
-> a string with the result data
-> an error code (if it returns an integer)
-> a redirect (if redirect was used).

# Why should GET requests be idempotent?

GET means (in this case):
 
You get a copy of what you requested, leaving the system you requested it from unchanged.

Therefore the get request is returning the same result,
when used multiple times when the system hasn't changed
by other means.

# Where should you format data for rendering?

In the templates (f.e. haml, css), not in app.rb or the other models.
